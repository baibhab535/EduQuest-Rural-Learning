# Lesson: Motion & Force

- **Motion**: A body is said to be in motion if its position changes with respect to time.
- **Force**: A push or pull acting on an object is called force.
- **Newton’s First Law**: A body continues to be in its state of rest or uniform motion unless an external force is applied.
- **Newton’s Second Law**: Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma).
- **Newton’s Third Law**: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
